# passwrd-manager
I've tried to create a password manager + random password generator here, this project is far from finished at the moment but ill be working on it regularly and keep updating it
 future plans include
 1) Adding some sort of encryption method to the txt files
 2) developing a gui
 3) making it into an exe (with gui) 
 4) will try to implement cloud support
